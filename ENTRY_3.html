                    <p>It was really well produced, and despite it being about two weeks since me writing this entry and watching it for the first time, it's still really fresh in my memory. The greatest accolade for a forgetful person like me.</p>

                    <p>The entire video makes a beautiful point of emphasizing the raw *intent* behind what we see, and who presents it. Not simply in the act of making, such as with a painter and the composition they choose, but with the reproductions of that painting. The camera, the light, the frame, the print, the environment, all of it serves to augment our perspective of a work of art.</p>

But here, the episode emphasizes so well how subliminally effective music is at altering our visual perspective. I loved seeing it :)</p>
