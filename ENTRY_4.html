                        for the past few months, I have been keeping a diary of my daily feelings, unique emotions, people I've met, and media I've loved. this piece uses all that information to produce a report, except that report is written in a constructed language that I made a while back. the report contains a lot of sensitive and emotional things, so I hope no one bothers to translate it. because as of this moment, the diary entries I used to write the report have been destroyed :) and so this is the only copy of the information on this paper, and no one on the planet is capable of accessing it! (except for me, but it'd take a long time to translate.)

                        one of the precious 233 months I've lived ever, locked away.</p>
